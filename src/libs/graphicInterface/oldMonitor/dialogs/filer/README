Here are list of items needing fixing the filer:

1) text_item needs to be able to enable/disable scrolling of text items
   - needs calls in ted_sm

2) need a more understandable paradigm for copy/copydir, rename, 
   and remove/rmdir. The paradigm now, is that whatever strings are supplied
   in the from and to fields become arguments to UNIX commands, therefore our
   semantics are those of /bin/cp.

3) At this time, the contents of the TO field are deleted when the FROM
   field is selected. The contents should be grayed, but not deleted.
