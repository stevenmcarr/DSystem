README for <$DSystem>/develop/src/libs/graphicInterface/cmdProcs/paraScopeEditor/stubs

This directory contains stubs that are needed for tools that use
pedInitialize and pedReinitialize with without using the graphical
user interface. These functions stub out functionality useful only
to the ParaScope Editor graphical user interface that are called
from the ped dg support library because of ill-conceived software
structure.

Reliance on the stubs file in this directory is HIGHLY DEPRECATED.
If you write new code and that depends on the existence of stubs
such as those in this directory, you should be ashamed of yourself.
