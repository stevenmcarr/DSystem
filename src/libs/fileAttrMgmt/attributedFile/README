README for <$DSYSTEM>/develop/src/libs/fileAttrMgmt/attributedFile


The files in this directory support the creation of 
"attributed files." Attributed files are simply files 
that you attach "attributes" to:

  Attribute - An "attribute" is any class that 
  inherits from the class Attribute. 

  Attributed File - An "attributed file" is any 
  class that inherits from the class AttributedFile. 
  You use the macro ATTACH_ATTRIBUTE to attach an 
  attribute to an attributed file. (ATTACH_ATTRIBUTE 
  lives in AttributedFile.h.)

  Attributed File Set - An "attributed file set" is 
  a collection of attributed files. 


In Figure 1 below, the classes FontAttr, LayoutAttr, 
and PublisherInfoAttr are all attributes, because 
they all inherit from Attribute. Likewise, TextFile 
and Chapter are attributed files, because they inherit 
from AttributedFile. The class Book is both an attri-
buted file and an attributed file set.

   Figure 1. The relationship between attributes, attributed 
   files, and attributed file sets. Arrows indicate attributes 
   that are attached to an attributed file.


Thus, the classes Attribute, AttributedFile, and AttributedFileSet 
are not used directly; they are used through inheritance. 

The classes that make up the attributed file abstraction are
 
   Attribute 
   AttributeConstructorRegistry 
   AttributeTable
   AttributeTableIterator
   AttributedFile
   RepositoryObjectComponentsIterator
   AttributedFileSet
   AttributedFileSetIterator
   FileSuffixHandle
   FileSuffixRegistry
   File
   FileTimeStamp
   RepositoryContext
