tcCheckSubstring:
	new code that checks error condition (non-id or subscript)
	is untested

private variable declarations:

	typechecker allows private declaration for a parallel loop 
	  index variable. is this legal?

	should a parallel loop declaration infer private variable status
	  for the loop index variable?

SAVE statements:
	storage class information not handled correctly

statement function invocations: 
	not expanded in tree. this causes problems for recording
	interprocedural information for function call sites
	that are in the statement function definition.
	need to declare a new tree node statement function
	invocation that has an expanded tree for the statement
	function invocation

character variables:
