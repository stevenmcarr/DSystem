README for <$DSystem>/develop/src/libs/ipAnalysis/callGraph


The files in this directory support the call graph 
abstraction, which is built on top of a directed graph. 

Known limitations:

  call graph building fails for programs that pass intrinsic 
  functions as procedure parameters at call sites. 

  some name table support code used here handles names only < 20 
  characters in length. this causes problems when processing codes 
  with long variable and procedure names.
  
These limitations will be addressed in a future release.
