The files in this directory support the creation of various 
directed graph routines.
 
  Directed Graph - A graph G = (V,E) whose edges are 
  ordered pairs of the form (v,w).


The following classes make up the directed graph abstraction:

  GVvector
  GVertex
  GEdge
  Graph
  GraphPredI
  GraphSuccI
  GraphVertexIterator

The following classes make up the dataflow analysis abstraction:

  DFProblem (can only be inherited from)
