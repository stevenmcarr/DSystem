This directory contains the files that support the creation
of non-uniform degree trees and non-uniform degree tree
traversal tools:

  Non-uniform Degree Tree - A cross between a generic tree 
  and a (circular) singly-linked list, as shown below. 

      parent
        |
        |
      child --> sibling --> sibling


The following classes make up this abstraction:

  NonUniformDegreeTreeIterator 
  NonUniformDegreeTreeNode
