README for <$DSYSTEM>/develop/src/libs/support/templates


This directory contains some experimental code for a template
that would be useful, unfortunately the link-time
instantiation provided by the Sun C++ 2.0.1 compiler rendered
it virtually impossible to use templates within the DSystem
code. As the C++ compilers we have available to use improve, 
perhaps this will become useful.
