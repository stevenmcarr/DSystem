README for <$DSYSTEM>/develop/src/libs/support/lists


The files in this directory support the creation of various 
types of lists and list utilities:

  Singly Linked List - A series of records in which 
  each record contains both an element and a pointer 
  to the next record. 

  Singly Linked List I/O - A utility that reads from 
  and writes to a singly linked list.

  Doubly Linked List - A series of records in which 
  each record contains an element, a pointer to the 
  next record, and a pointer to the previous record. 


The following classes make up the singly linked list abstraction:

  SinglyLinkedListEntry
  SinglyLinkedList
  SinglyLinkedListIterator

The following class makes up the singly linked list I/O abstraction:

  SinglyLinkedListEntryIO (inherits from SinglyLinkedListEntry)
  SinglyLinkedListIO (inherits from SinglyLinkedList)
 
The following class makes up the circular doubly linked list abstraction:

  DList
