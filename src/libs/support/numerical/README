README for <$DSYSTEM>/develop/src/libs/support/numerical 


The files in this directory support the creation of utilities 
described in Press' "Numerical Recipes in C" and Knuth's 
"The Art of Computer Science,Fundamental Algorithms." 

Implementations from "Numerical Recipes in C" include a chi-
squared fit routine, and implementations from  "The Art of 
Computer Science" include an extended gcd (greatest common 
divisor) routine.
