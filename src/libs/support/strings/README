README for <$DSYSTEM>/develop/src/libs/support/strings


This files in this directory support the creation of various 
string utilities:

  OrderedSetOfStrings creates a vector of strings that can 
  be read from and written to a file.

  StringBuffer builds strings of arbitrary length through 
  a sequence of Append operations.

  StringIO provides a simple interface for reading and 
  writing ASCII strings.

  StringSet creates a set of string pointers.


The following class supports the ordered set of strings abstraction:

  OrderedSetOfStrings (inherits from PointerVector)
 
The following class supports the string buffer abstraction:

  StringBuffer

The following classes support the string set abstraction:

  StringSet (inherits from NamedObjectTableIO)
  StringSetIterator (inherits from NamedObjectTableIterator)
