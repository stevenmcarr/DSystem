The files in these subdirectories produce executables for 

  o the control flow graph
  o the control dependence graph generator
  o the syntax and semantic checker  
  o the Fortran D compiler
  o the Fortran D editor

The Fortran D compiler translates sequential Fortran programs
with data decomposition directives into message-passing 
Fortran 77 programs.

The Fortran D editor provides information about parallelism 
and communication placement in Fortran D programs.
